# Starting from scratch

When you start creating a new design don't worry about the layout of the app you're creating and only focus on the most important components of the app.

Start designing the main features and components of the app you're creating. Sometimes you'll realize that you're app doesn't even need a navigation or a footer.

In the beginning of a new design don't stress over the color schemes and fonts. You can change these things later on. Focus on the main layout of the component you're designing as these are the things that you should focus on when starting a new design.

Create your initial designs in gray-scale and don't introduce color to the design until it is finalized. This will allow you to experiment with spacing, contrast and size of the design and you'll end up with a cleaner design that you can add color to whenever you want.

You don't have to implement every single feature that your app is capable of in the beginning. Only design the essential features and then keep designing other features one by one and improving on the ones that are already built.

Figuring out every single edge case that can happen while the end-user is using your app is just not possible and you shouldn't try to solve them all. very design has it's own personality. A corporate website or banking app might have a professional look and feel to it while the landing page for a new startup might offer fun and interactive vibes. Keep fonts simple in corporate websites and you can play with them

when designing a landing page for a product or agency. Color is another important factor to consider when designing because each color responds to a different emotion in humans. Blue feels familiar, Gold and silver feel expensive and sophisticated while pink, orange, and yellow have a colorful vibe to them. Rounded corners or straight corners in your designs also have a impact on how the user sees your design. This is a very small detail that shouldn't be overlooked.

Using a formal tone in the text areas of the design such as instructions and greetings will give the sense of professionalism and using a casual tone will make your design more friendlier to the end-user.

Try to systematize everything even margins and borders. A design system takes a lot of time to be perfect. Just start with the essentials like fonts and colors and keep on adding other styles as you work.
