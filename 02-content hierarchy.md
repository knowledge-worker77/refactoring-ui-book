# Content hierarchy

Without proper visual hierarchy your designs will look noisy and un-organized. If you plan out visual hierarchy correctly in your designs even the most basic ones will look nice. Styling an element is not the only thing that will make it look good. You'll also need the perfect visual hierarchy within your elements to really make them look good.

Relying solely on the size of your headings and body text to convey your message is a big mistake. Experiment with the font-weight and color as well the size.

Making the heading bolder and changing the color of the supporting text to the accent color is a great way to represent hierarchy in headings. If your background is white using a light grey shade will make it look nice but on colored backgrounds this will not work. Instead what you can do is choose a color that is closer to the background color.

Using grey text on a background that is an image or has a pattern is also not recommended because if the text is to transparent it will make the pattern see through and this will effect users in reading the text. 

Sometimes an element will require more emphasize but there will be room for it. For scenarios like these you can change the color that item. Like in a navigation bar change the colors of the active link to primary color or make the contact link more appealing by changing it's background.

When displaying data you can easily make a mistake of handling each field like a label. By using this approach all your data will have equal emphasize and no visual hierarchy.

In designs like a dashboard, labels are not required and should be treated as a supporting content. The data displayed in the graphs on the dashboard is what matters most and should be easily readable.

If you're building designs like a technical specifications table then you need to emphasize on the labels as you're displaying data in a table format Combining labels with a value can be a better to display information.

In a pricing component that also shows the amount of stock for that item make the title and stock count of the same color and display it like Only 12 left in stock. This will relay the message that this product is a high selling one.

When building for the web try to use semantic tags for headings, make sure your section titles look like headings and not labels. The content should be the main attraction of a section not it's heading. 

Don’t let the element you’re using influence how you choose to style it. Bold text looks better than regular text because it uses more surface area than regular text.

Icons also have this effect, If you place a solid icon next to normal text the icon will look more emphasized. 

When designing a component that has multiple actions that the user can perform than you should focus on the hierarchy of the elements and not about semantics.

## Layout and Spacing

One of the easiest methods of designing a good UI is that you use all the white/negative space that is available and let your UI breath. Give your elements more white space than they require and then keep removing it until your design looks perfect.

Don't waste your time on deciding how many pixels should the margin and padding of an element be. Decide these values beforehand and limit yourself to only use them as they won't create any inconsistencies in your design.

A simple approach is to start with a sensible base value, then build a scale using factors and multiples of that value.

16 pixels is a great number to start with because it divides nicely, and also happens to be the default font size in every major web browser. 

For a system to be truly useful, it needs to take into consideration the relative difference between adjacent values. Since most of the users use their mobiles for accessing the web try using a mobile-first approach, design for a smaller screen and then keep making the necessary adjustments for bigger screens.

Give each element just the space it needs don’t make something worse just to make it match something else.

Using a column layout is also a great way to use extra screen real-estate but don't force your UIs to be crammed in small spaces if you want to use the extra space then use it.

Using a grid system will keep your UIs simple and clean but not all elements should be designed with a grid system. The problem with treating grid systems like a religion is that there are a lot of situations where it makes much more sense for an element to have a fixed width instead of a relative width.

Not every part of an interface should be sized relative to one another, and that if element A needs to shrink by 25% on smaller screens, that element B should shrink by 25%, too.

Let go of the idea that everything needs to scale proportionately giving yourself the freedom to fine-tune things independently makes it a hell of a lot easier to design for multiple contexts.
