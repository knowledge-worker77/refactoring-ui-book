# Typography

If your design team doesn't have a design system which defines the font-faces, weight, and size of the text in your UIs you are going to have a hard time deciding how should should text look like in your design which leads to inconsistent designs and slow workflow.

When you’re building a type scale, don’t use em units to define your sizes. Because em units are relative to the current font size, the computed font size of nested elements is often not actually a value in your scale.

With thousands of different typefaces out there to choose from, separating the good from the bad can be an intimidating task.

For UI design, your safest bet is a fairly neutral sans-serif, think something like Helvetica. You can also use the system default fonts, this is not the greatest option available but the user will be used seeing the font and the text will blend more with the system applications.

Don't pick a font-style that has five or less weights. Pick the ones that have more than seven or ten font weights so that you can play around with the font weights.

Make your paragraphs wide enough to fit between 45 and 75 characters per line. But, if you're mixing mixing paragraph text with images or other large components, you should still limit the paragraph width even if the overall content area needs to be wider to accommodate the other elements.

Line height is added to text to make it more readable and makes it easier for the reader to find where the text wraps. If you add a external link in your text make sure that the link stands out from rest of the text. Make it "pop" by changing the font color and adding a underline to it.

You don't have to emphasize on each link, If you’ve got links in your interface that are really ancillary and not part of the main path a user takes through the application, consider adding an underline or changing the color only when the user hovers over them.

Align your text so that it has the best readability for the user. If the text is in a language that is read in LTR (left to right) like english the text should be left aligned. If it's in a RTL (right to left) like persian or arabic the text should be right aligned.

Numbers should always be right aligned and when the decimal in a list of numbers is always in the same place, they’re a lot easier to compare at a glance. 

Use hyphenation and justify text so that it will look good on the web as well as on print. You can make the titles or headlines more compact by adding more weight to them to add a condensed look.
