# Working with images

Bad photos will ruin a design, even if everything else about it looks great.If your design needs photography and you’re not a talented photographer,  you’ve got two options:

- Hire a professional photographer.

- Use high quality stock photography

Adding text to images is a tricky thing to workout, use an overlay to increase the overall contrast. Another way to help text stand out against an image is to colorize the image with a single color.

Don't upscale images, this will make them look fuzzy and they will loose their definition. Make sure to use SVG icons as you can manipulate them at will. When you’re depending on user-uploaded images, you don’t have the luxury of fine-tuning contrast, carefully adjusting colors, or cropping the perfect frame.

Instead of letting users wreak havoc on your page structure, center their images inside fixed containers, cropping out anything that doesn’t fit.

If the uploaded image has the same background as your UI then the background can bleed together, use a box shadow to prevent this from happening.

## Leveling up

You don’t always have to add new elements to a design to add flare there are a lot of ways to liven up a page by “supercharging” what’s already there. 

Add check marks or icons when designing lists. Change the font to a more elegant one when designing testimonials.

If you’re working on a form, using custom check boxes and radio buttons is an easy way to add some color to the design.

Add a border using accents colors to cards. Change the background to a gradient or illustration.

If the design includes an empty state then make it like the rest of the design and don't overlook it
Don't overdo borders and make everything look boxy. Have fun, experiment, think outside the box just don't do the same thing that everyone else is doing.
